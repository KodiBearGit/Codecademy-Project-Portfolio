## General info

Project Requirements

* Project Prompt - Portfolio websites are key to your career in web development; they let you show off all the awesome projects that you've made and provide a way for people to get in touch with you.  
* Utilize Codecademy Kanban boards to track project completion.  
* For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that youâ€™ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.
