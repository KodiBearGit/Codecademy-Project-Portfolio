## General info

Project Requirements

* Project Prompt - Portfolio websites are key to your career in web development; they let you show off all the awesome projects that you've made and provide a way for people to get in touch with you.  
* Utilize Codecademy Kanban boards to track project completion.  
* For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that you’ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.
